                        matters. Money begets
                        money. If you don't have that, you wait around to be hired by somebody at the mercy of others.
                        If
                        you have that money in your hand, you desperately try to make the best use of it and move
                        ahead.If you imagine,Some day it will happen. If you don't imagine, It will never happen. One
                        day our grandchildren will go to museums to see what poverty was like. If you are born into a
                        poor family, if you are a woman you have seen the worst of poverty.
